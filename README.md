# lenapy-2.0
The source code for Lenapy discord bot, version 2.0

Disclamer :
It's 12 a.m. and I have a very shitty english !

There you will find the source code for the Lenapy discord bot, working mainly with the discord.py library
Not all the functions are commented (fiew are in fact...)

Also, sometimes you will find some variables with strange names (mainly "ballerine" in fact). It's because I usualy develop the bot at night and the strange name for tempoary variables are more easy to differentiate than "temp", "temp1" etc...

So ! Good luck !
